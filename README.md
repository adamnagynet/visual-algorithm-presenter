Visual algorithm presenter - Visualizing data structures and algorithms through animations

The "Visual algorithm presenter" uses animations to present the computer science material learned during high school years. The program includes animations of the most important tasks of searches, sorting, "Backtrack" and "Divide et impera" methods: sequential and binary search; bubble, insertion, minimum (or maximum) selection and counting, within the "Backtracking" method you can learn the task of "8 Queens" and the task of "missionaries and cannibals". The "Divide et Impera" method is described by the "Hanoi Towers", quicksort, and mergesort algorithms.
