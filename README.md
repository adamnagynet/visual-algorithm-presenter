### **Visual algorithm presenter** — Visualizing data structures and algorithms through animations

The "Visual algorithm presenter" is a tool that helps better understand **data structures and algorithms** learned during high school years by using simple geometric animations. The program includes presentations of the most prominent **searching**, **sorting**, **backtracking**, and **divide et impera** methods.

The software was written in _Object Pascal_ language using Borland Delphi in **2003** — the year Android company was founded, and Steve Jobs announced iTunes for Windows — using Hungarian as display language.
